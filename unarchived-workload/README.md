## Unarchived Workload

- This page keeps records of workloads that are appear in other papers, but I haven't archived them, or they are not made public.



### Web service, from paper [Utilizing Green Energy Prediction to Schedule Mixed Batch and Service Jobs in Data Centers ](http://seelab.ucsd.edu/papers/aksanli_hotpower_2011.pdf)
- [Rubis](http://rubis.ow2.org/)
  - target response time: 150ms
  - service time: 12ms for each request
  - client arrival: exponential
  - inter arrival: lognormal distribution with mean 100ms
- Comment: this workloads need to be run on real computers to get the running time of jobs.

### Batch jobs from paper [Utilizing Green Energy Prediction to Schedule Mixed Batch and Service Jobs in Data Centers ](http://seelab.ucsd.edu/papers/aksanli_hotpower_2011.pdf)
- [Map Reduce Job](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=5493490)
  - Mean measured service time: 10 minutes
  - Max service time: 20 min
