DataCenterWorkloads
===================

### Objective
The objective of this project is to study the characteristic of data center workloads. In specific, we are going to do the following things
- Analyze the characteristics of data center workloads including
  - job process time, job arrival pattern, job size distribution etc.
- Pre-processing jobs to create workloads in the input of simulation
